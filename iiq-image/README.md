# IIQ Image Details üõ†Ô∏è

IIQ requires MySQL as its database server, so both containers(IIQ+MySQL) need to be running and connected.

- The IIQ image is built using `Dockerfile`.
- Environment variables are configured through the `.env` file.
- IIQ application setup is handled by `/script/install_iiq.sh` and customized using Tomcat config from `/config/*`.
- The `identityiq.war` file in `/build/deploy` is a placeholder and should be replaced with a current or customer-specific artifact.
- Once built, push the image to a container repository for Kubernetes deployment.
