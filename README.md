# Project to containerize IIQ and deploy in EKS cluster.
This project aims to containerize the IIQ application.

This repository is organized into modular platform components, each representing a distinct domain in the IIQ delivery ecosystem:
‚Ä¢ `eks-cluster-iiq`: Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
‚Ä¢ `gitops-iiq`: GitOps bootstrapping and cluster-specific manifests
‚Ä¢ `image-iiq`: Container image build and deployment scripts
‚Ä¢ `pipeline-iiq`: CI/CD pipeline definitions 
‚Ä¢ `docker-compose-test-iiq`: Local development and testing setup for iiq

## IIQ Image Details üõ†Ô∏è

- The IIQ image is always built from the `image-iiq/Dockerfile` directory.
- It must include the latest or customized `identityiq.war` file in `image-iiq/build/deploy`.
- Once built, push the image to a container repository for Kubernetes deployment.

## Testing the IIQ Image Using Docker Compose üê≥

Docker Compose is used to verify IdentityIQ's functionality and connectivity with MySQL and `identityiq.war`.

To run the project, simply execute:

```bash
cd docker-compose-test-iiq
docker compose up
```

This will apply the `compose.yml` configuration and create two containers:

- `iiq-container-poc_iiq_1`
- `iiq-container-poc_db_1`

Once started successfully, access the application at:  
**https://docker-host-ip:9000/identityiq/**

IdentityIQ requires MySQL as its database server, so both containers need to be running and connected.

- The IIQ image is built using `image-iiq/Dockerfile`.
- Environment variables are configured through the `.env` file.
- IIQ application setup is handled by `image-iiq/script/install_iiq.sh` and customized using Tomcat config from `image-iiq/config/*`.
- The `identityiq.war` file in `image-iiq/build/deploy` is a placeholder and should be replaced with a current or customer-specific artifact.

## IIQ Build Pipeline ‚öôÔ∏è

The build pipeline should:

1. Build the IdentityIQ application from `image-iiq/build/identityiq.zip` and output to `image-iiq/build/deploy/identityiq.war`.
2. Build the IIQ Docker image.
3. Push the image to a container repository.

## ArgoCD Deployment üöÄ

ArgoCD is used to deploy IdentityIQ to a Kubernetes cluster.  
Find the ArgoCD configuration here:  
[GitOps Kubernetes ArgoCD Configuration](https://github.com/vgupta619/iiq-eks-cluster-2025.git/gitops-iiq/)

ArgoCD will automatically detect and deploy the latest image from the repository.

## IIQ EKS Clustert 
Cluster can be create using terraform from - `/eks-cluster-iiq`
1. Saperate EKS cluster for dev and prod.
2. Aurora as DB cluster, 
    1. provisioned aurora for Prod.
    2. Serverless aurora for Dev.
